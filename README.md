# San Andreas Highway Patrol - Asset Installation Instructions

**REMINDER: All Assets are included in this pack and should all be in a combined folder called [SAHP_Assets_Pack]

## Step 1: Folder Creation

First of, Before even downloading the San Andreas Highway Patrol assets make sure that within your FiveM Server Resources folder you have a folder created called [SAHP_Assets_Pack] 
Make sure not to deviate from this name so the Assets will work correctly.

## Step 2: Gamebuilds & Server Builds

Its important for the San Andreas Highway Patrol Assets to be run on a minimum server artifacts version of 5181 (/server:5181) and client gamebuild 2944 (/gamebuild:2944) or later, This is important so DO NOT skip this step.

## Step 3: Configuring Server.cfg file

Its important to configure your server.cfg file correctly, Its important for the San Andreas Highway Patrol Assets folder [SAHP_Assets_Pack] to be started before any other vehicle, script or EUP Pack to avoid conflicting files. This way we can ensure that everything will work as designed. To start all SAHP Related resources simply start the entire resource folder [SAHP_Assets_Pack] as `ensure [SAHP_Assets_Pack]` and this will start all resources in the right order.

## Step 4: Downloading The Files & Placing Them In the [SAHP_Assets_Folder]

Now you can download the Assets from the respective repositories, And place the full resource in the [SAHP_Assets_Folder], Just download and drag the downloaded folder into it. DO NOT edit the fxmanifest files or move around folders as this will significantly affect the Assets and they might break.
